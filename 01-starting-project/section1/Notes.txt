React is a library primarily used for building user interfaces.
Components in React are JavaScript functions extended to encapsulate HTML elements.
This encapsulation facilitates code reusability and encapsulation of logic and presentation.
React organizes components into a tree structure before rendering them into the Document Object Model (DOM).
Props (short for properties) are used to configure custom component attributes.
Props allow for dynamic and flexible behavior of components.
We can seperate out the folders for components and special files for the css also.
if we not pass any prop object a default prop object will always be passed and if you use the component like (<dummy>MidThingy</dummy>) . 
The MidThingy will be your {props.children.}. This terminology is called component compistiton
